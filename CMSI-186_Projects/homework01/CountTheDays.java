/**
 *  File name     :  CountTheDays.java
 *  Purpose       :  Program to count the days between two dates
 *  Author        :  B.J. Johnson
 *  Date          :  2017-01-02
 *  Description   :  This program calculates and displays the number of days between two dates that are
 *                   passed as arguments on the command line.  The order of the *dates* is not considered
 *                   important, but the order of each date must be "month, day, year".  Inputs are parsed
 *                   from the "args" command line arguments array and are validated.  Use is made of the
 *                   helper class "CalendarStuff.java" to accomplish most of the calculations.
 *  Notes         :  None
 *  Warnings      :  None
 *  Exceptions    :  None
