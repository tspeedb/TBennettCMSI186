Nice work!

Your error handler doesn't work correctly for standalone operation.
I tried "java DynamicChangeMaker 2,3 5" and got the error message:

Denominations must all be integers greater than or equal to one.
Please enter a a comma-separated list with values you would like to make, followed by a total amount.

....which is what I put in......  :)
